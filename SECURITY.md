# JanMat Security Policy

This document explains which versions of JanMat we support and how to report security issues.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.0   | ✅        |
| < 1.0   | ❌        |

Only the current release (1.0.0) receives security fixes and guidance. Older, pre-release code is not supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the project maintainer:

- Email: karanyyede@gmail.com
- Subject: [JanMat Security] Brief summary of the issue
- Include: affected version, clear steps to reproduce, minimal proof‑of‑concept (PoC), expected vs actual behavior, and any suggested mitigation/workaround. Attach logs or screenshots if helpful.

Do not open a public GitHub issue for vulnerabilities — use the private email above.

## What to Expect

- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
- Initial triage: within 7 calendar days (priority level assigned).
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and complexity. We will provide regular status updates (at least weekly) until resolved.
- Patch delivery: security fixes are released as a tagged GitHub release and documented in CHANGELOG.md. When feasible, patches are backported to the supported release.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We request coordinated disclosure:
- Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix is released or we agree on a disclosure timeline.
- If you require faster action or need a CVE assigned, indicate that in your initial report.

## Emergency Contact & PGP

If you need an encrypted report, reply asking for the maintainer's PGP key and we will provide it. Otherwise use the email above.

## No Bounty Program

There is currently no formal bug bounty program. Reports are welcomed and credited in release notes when appropriate.
